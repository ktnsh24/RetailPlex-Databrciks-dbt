# RetailPlex-Databrciks-dbt

This project simulates a **retail analytics platform** where data is ingested from multiple sources (streaming, batch, and reference data) and staged in **Databricks Unity Catalog** under the catalog `retailplex_platform` and schema `landing`.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Data Sources

### 1. Streaming Multiplex Data
- Arrives as **JSONL** files under:  

/Volumes/retailplex_platform/landing/raw_files/incoming_multiplex_data/retailplex_multiplex_stream_<timestamp>.jsonl

- Each file contains multiple **topics**:
- `customers` â†’ customer profile data  
- `products` â†’ product master data  
- `orders` â†’ customer orders  
- `events` â†’ customer browsing and interaction events  

---

### 2. Reference Data (Broadcast Tables)
- Small, relatively static lookup/enrichment datasets in **CSV format**.  
- Stored under:  

/Volumes/retailplex_platform/landing/raw_files/refdata/

- Includes:
- `Customer_segments.csv`
- `Geography.csv`
- `Product_categories.csv`
- `Product_subcategories.csv`
- `Suppliers.csv`

---

### 3. Batch Data (Singleplex Full Load)
- Large transactional dataset refreshed **daily as a full load**.  
- Stored under:  

/Volumes/retailplex_platform/landing/raw_files/batch_data/batch_order_items.csv

- Loaded as managed table: landing.batch_order_items.
- Provides **order lineâ€“level transactions** linking customers, orders, products, and events.  

---
So far, the landing schema acts as the raw ingestion zone:

- Streaming JSON lines (multiplex)
- Referential CSVs (refdata)
- Bulk batch CSV (batch_order_items)

These datasets are the foundation for downstream bronze â†’ silver â†’ gold processing in the medallion architecture.

## âœ… Key Understanding
- **Multiplex streaming JSONL** â†’ multiple topics intermixed, need to be split into separate raw Bronze tables.  
- **Broadcast/reference CSVs** â†’ lookup dimensions for enrichment and joins.  
- **Batch CSV (order items)** â†’ fact-level transactional data, refreshed daily.  
- Together, these represent the **raw landing zone** of the Medallion Architecture before transformation into Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layers.
